# Red-Black_Tree
Red-Black Tree Visualization
 - This visualization demonstrates how a red-black tree works with insert, delete, find, and print functionality.

This red-black tree visualization is a modified version of the red-black tree visualization here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html

The source code for the original red-black tree visualization and many other visualizations can be found here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/source.html

Dr. Galles's tutorial for creating data structure visualizations, which I used for this project, is also found in the link above.

My Red-Black.html file should go in the main folder "JavascriptVisualRelease" (where all the other html files are).
My Red-Black.js file should go in the "AlgorithmLibrary" folder (where all the other js files are).

Opening the html file in your browser will allow you to use the visualization. Using the visualization is very straightforward and should be self-explanatory.
