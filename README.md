# Red-Black_Tree
Red-Black Tree Visualization
 - Demonstrates how a red-black tree works with insert, delete, find, and print functionality.

This red-black tree visualization is a modified version of the following red-black tree visualization: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html

The source code for the red-black tree visualization represented in the link above (as well as many other visualizations) can be found here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/source.html
The code is released under a Free BSD license.

Dr. Galles's tutorial for creating data structure visualizations, which I used for this project, is also found in the link above.

To install this project locally: 
1) Download Dr. Galles's source code: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/source.html
2) Put my Red-Black.html file in the main folder "JavascriptVisualRelease" (where all the other html files are).
3) Put my Red-Black.js file in the "AlgorithmLibrary" folder (where all the other js files are).

Opening the html file in your browser will allow you to use the visualization. Using the visualization is very straightforward. Some more info on how to use the visualization can be found here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/about.html
